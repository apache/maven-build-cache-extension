## Getting Started

To on-board incremental Maven you need to complete several steps:

* Declare caching extension in your project (either in `pom.xml` or `.mvn/extensions.xml`)
* Add `maven-cache-config.xml` cache config in `.mvn/` (optional) to customize default behavior
* Validate build results and iteratively, adjust config to properly reflect project specifics
* Setup remote cache (optional)

### Declaring build cache extension

```xml
<extension>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.extensions</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-build-cache-extension</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</extension>
```

either in `pom.xml`'s `<project>/<build>/<extensions>` or in `.mvn/extensions.xml`'s `<extensions>`

### Adding build cache config

Copy [default config `maven-cache-config.xml`](./maven-cache-config.xml)
to [`.mvn/`](https://maven.apache.org/configure.html) directory of your project.  
To get overall understanding of build cache machinery, it is recommended to review the config and read comments. In typical
scenario you need to adjust:

* Exclusions for unstable, temporary files or environment specific files
* Plugins reconciliation rules â€“ add critical plugins parameters to reconciliation
* Source code files selectors. Though source code locations discovered automatically from project and plugins config,
  there might be edge cases.
* remote cache location (if remote cache is used)

### Adjusting build cache config

Having extension run usual command, like `mvn package`. Verify the caching engine is activated:

* Check log output - there should be cache related output or initialization error message.
* Navigate to your local repo directory - there should be a sibling directory `cache` next to the usual
  local `repository`.
* Find `buildinfo.xml` in the cache repository for typical module and review it. Ensure that
  * expected source code files are present in the build info
  * all critical plugins and their critical parameters are covered by config

It is recommended to find the best working trade-off between fairness and cache efficiency. Adding unnecessary rules and
checks could reduce both performance and cache efficiency (hit rate).

### Adding caching CI and remote cache

To leverage remote cache feature there should a shared storage provide. Any technology supported
by [Maven Resolver](https://maven.apache.org/resolver/) will suffice. In simplest form it could be a http web server which
supports get/put operations ([Nginx OSS](http://nginx.org/en/) with fs module or any other equivalent).
See [Remote cache setup](remote-cache.md) for detailed description of cache setup.
