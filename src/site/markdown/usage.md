## Normal usage

Once extension is activated, cache will kick-in automatically on every lifecycle build of phase `package` or higher.

## Subtree builds

Build could be invoked on any module in project and will try to discover cache by introspecting dependencies. In order
to identify which dependencies are part of cacheable project the cache engine needs to know:

* full project root location which must be passed with `-Dmaven.multiModuleProjectDirectory`
* Specify profiles which activate full graph in config:

```
TBD
```

## Disable cache

Disable in config:
```xml
<cache>
  <configuration>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </configuration>
</cache>
```
On command line:
```
-Dmaven.build.cache.enabled=false
```

## IDE support

Cache extension is generally compatible with ides with one limitation:

* The cache doesn't restore full project state. Compiled classes and other output directories will not be restored from
  cache if `clean` was invoked. In order to work efficiently, IDE should be configured to not use maven
  output (`target`) directories for compilation. In that case compilation caches will be maintained by IDE leveraging
  both fast builds and fast compilation
